## User Experience (UX)

- ### Users stories

    - #### General public an potential partners
        - As a visitor, I want to easily navigate through the web page and find the information that is relevant to me.
        - As a visitor, I want to know more about the company, their history and how they operate, look for social media presence and be able to contact them.

    - #### Site owner
        - As a site owner, I want to create a online presence and allow the general public to know more about the brand.
        - As a site owner, I want to be visible to as much potencial partners as possible


- ### Design

    - #### Colour scheme
        - The two main colours are yellow and green, the same as the country flag what gives a identity to the company.
    - #### Typography
        - The Acme and Exo fonts are the two fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I choosed those two fonts because they are less formal and as a juice company we want to have a more relaxed and close relationship with the public.

I runned a test on the contact form
If you try to submit it without feeling the spaces and I wasn't aloud. You can only submit the form after all the spaces being filled.
You also need to give a valid e-mail, otherwise the system will show a error message.
