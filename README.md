**Contact form:**
I runned a test on the contact form
If you try to submit it without feeling the spaces and I wasn't aloud. You can only submit the form after all the spaces being filled.
You also need to give a valid e-mail, otherwise the system will show a error message.
After you fill all the required and valid information you can submit the form and a succes message will show up.
