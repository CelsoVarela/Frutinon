In this "project" you can find a landing page of a Juice company where the users and partners can search for information using the navigation buttons and contact them submitting a form.
The webpage is fully operational and responsive through all devices.
You can see the company web page [here](https://celsovarela.github.io/Frutinon/)


## User Experience (UX)

- ### Users stories

    - #### General public an potential partners
        - As a visitor, I want to easily navigate through the web page and find the information that is relevant to me.
        - As a visitor, I want to know more about the company, their history, and how they operate, look for social media presence and be able to contact them.

    - #### Site owner
        - As a site owner, I want to create an online presence and allow the general public to know more about the brand.
        - As a site owner, I want to be visible to as many potential partners as possible.


- ### Design

    - #### Colour scheme
        - The two main colors are yellow and green, the same as the country flag which gives an identity to the company.
    - #### Typography
        - The Acme and Exo fonts are the two fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in a case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I choose those two fonts because they are less formal and as a juice company we want to have a more relaxed and close relationship with the public.
